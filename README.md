# dsh-google-search-plugin

A **DeepSeek Harness (DSH) plugin** that gives the agent a working web-search tool by
registering **Google** as the first planned search backend behind DSH's web capability
seam (`ctx.web`).

This repository is the home of the plugin's engineering and architecture contracts, and,
in later issues, its runtime implementation.

## What this plugin is

- A **DSH plugin** that integrates with the DeepSeek Harness [web capability seam](ARCHITECTURE.md)
  (`ctx.web`, owned by `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web`).
- It registers a **search provider** — a small adapter that turns a normalized search
  request into a Google search call and maps Google's response back to the normalized
  search result.
- **Google** is the **initial planned backend for the MVP** (the first planned search
  backend). The initial target is Google Programmable Search — Custom Search JSON API
  semantics; the concrete Google search product/API is an **adapter-layer choice** and
  not part of the domain contract.
- Its runtime configuration requires an **API credential** and, where the selected Google
  product requires it, a **search engine id (`cx`)** — supplied at runtime, never
  committed (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), "Initial Google backend target
  (MVP)").
- It speaks the stable, **provider-neutral search domain contract**. Google's wire
  format stays inside the adapter and never leaks into the domain model.
- It is **search-only** in its first release: it makes the model-facing `web_search`
  tool able to discover current information on the web.

## What this plugin is not

- **Not a page reader / fetcher.** Search (discovery) and Fetch/Read (retrieval of a
  specific URL's content) are **separate capabilities** on the seam. This plugin's first
  release implements **search only**; Fetch/Read is out of scope.
- **Not a new model-facing tool.** It does not invent a new tool schema. It supplies a
  **provider** to the existing `web_search` tool through `ctx.web.registerSearchProvider`.
- **Not a multi-provider abstraction layer.** Google is the first planned backend. The
  domain boundary is kept just wide enough to avoid coupling the domain model to Google's
  wire format — nothing more. That boundary is what keeps a future migration to, or
  addition of, another Google search API/product an adapter-layer change that does not
  touch the Harness-facing search domain contract.
- **Not a credentials store.** Google API credentials are supplied at runtime via
  environment variables. They are **never committed** and **never stored in ordinary
  settings** (see [ENGINEERING.md](ENGINEERING.md)).

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Product positioning — what the plugin is and is not (this file). |
| `ENGINEERING.md` | Normative engineering principles for human and AI contributors. |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | The stable domain vs external-provider boundary, the initial Google backend target (MVP) and its configuration shape, the Search / Fetch-Read capability split, and first-release scope + non-goals. |

## Status

Issue #1 establishes the project-level contracts (this file, `ENGINEERING.md`, and
`ARCHITECTURE.md`). Runtime implementation and live Google API calls are explicitly
**out of scope** for this issue and arrive in later issues.
